## Requirements

- XCode 13.1+ with IOS compiler supporting v14 or v15.
- Apple developer account
  - Register your developer account with Apple and associate with the project build settings for a digital signature to compile.
    - Download developer management app from AppStore
    - Another option is to utilize the web portal
      - https://developer.apple.com/enroll/app
     - If issues prevent registration or activation of your developer account, contact Apple developer program 1-800-692-7753 for manual review
    - Once approved, associate project build settings with your developer account.

## Installation

- Fork/Clone Github repository
- Adjust build settings to include your developer account
- Known issues with M1 mac (Arm64)
  - To increase compatibility, run Xcode with Rosetta enabled. 
    - Right click on the Xcode icon, in popup window make sure that Open using Rosetta is checked.
  - Known project dependencies that needed to be refreshed to work on M1 chipset
    - https://github.com/skywinder/web3swift
    - https://github.com/jrendel/SwiftKeychainWrapper 
- Build & Test!
- You may run on device as well.Please unzip the frameworks for arm64 and replace in Framework folder in SDK and Sample app

## Structure
The SDK connects to Mainnet network by default. This can be changed in SDK like this
Configuration.changeEnvironment(isProduction: false) -- Alfajores
Configuration.changeEnvironment(isProduction: true) -- Mainnet

### Workspace
The project is supplied as a workspace with both the SDK and Sample reference app. Utilize the CeloIOSWorkspace.xcworkspace

(Not a needed Step) But in case of any changes performed in framework ,please select the celo-sdk-ios and build the application

## SDK Usage

Import the SDK
import celo_sdk_ios

Import PromiseKit.Promises simplify asynchronous programming.
import PromiseKit


Initialize and generate current Account without any password
```swift
CeloSDK.shared.initializeWalletConnect {
            print("address\(CeloSDK.currentAccount?.address)")
}
```
Get current account wallet address
```swift
CeloSDK.currentAccount?.address
```

Initialize contract kit instance
```swift
let contractkit = CeloSDK.shared.contractKit
```

(Important step)
First fetch the Stable Token Address ,this will internally set it as the FeeCurrency in the ContractKit 
```swift
 firstly {
   StableTokenWrapper().getStableTokenAddress()
        }.then { address in
  print(address)
            
        }
```

Set the feeCurrency by passing the Celo FeeCurrency for specific Stable Token
```swift
contractkit.setFeeCurrency(feeCurrency: mFeeCurrency)
 mFeeCurrency - CUSD Fee Currency
```

Get the feeCurrency for specific Stable Token
```swift
contractkit.getFeeCurrency()
```


Get CUSD Balance for an address
```swift
 firstly {
  contractkit.getStableTokenBalanceOf(currentAddress:mAddress)
    }.done { balance in
  print(balance)
    }
 mAddress - User's wallet Address
```

Get Native Celo Balance

```swift
 contractkit.calculateCELO()

```

Get GasPriceMinimum for a Token 

```swift
 firstly {
     CeloSDK.shared.contractKit.getGaspriceMinimum(tokenType:CeloContractClass.StableToken)
        }.done {gasPrice in
        print(gasPrice)
       }
```

StableToken transfer

```swift
firstly {
       CeloSDK.shared.contractKit.transfer(amount: self.fromAddressField.text!, toAddress: self.toAddressField.text!)
        }.done { txRecieptHash in
            print(txRecieptHash)
        }
```

Initialize contract kit instance for a specific web3 instance and abi hosted in your network
```swift
let contract = CeloSDK.shared.contractKit.getContractKit(web3Instance: CeloSDK.web3Net, abi, at: EthereumAddress(contractAddress)!)
```

```
To set web3 url instance
```swift
let web3net = try CeloSDK.customNet(url: "")
This can be accessed from SDK via CeloSDK.web3Net
```



Generating a new account with password
```swift
CeloSDK.account.generateAccount(password)
```

Import account with password and mnemonic
```swift
CeloSDK.account.importAccount(mnemonics, password)
CeloSDK.account.importAccount(privateKey, password)
```

Get mnemonics
```swift
CeloSDK.shared.mnemonics
```

Get private key with Password
```swift
CeloSDK.shared.privateKey(password: mPassWord)
```
